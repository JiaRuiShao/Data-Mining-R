## Data Mining using R

__Overview__:  

Data Mining is the process by which useful information is extracted from large amounts of data. This course is designed to provide students with the necessary tools and techniques to perform data mining and business analytics. This course is intended as an introductory module targeted at individuals who plan to work with data (modeling, data management) as well as towards those who will work with data scientists. While the course will primarily focus on modeling and evaluation, it will also include data preparation and examination. Modeling techniques covered include decision trees, clustering, and other methods. Emphasis will be placed on the entire context surrounding data mining, which includes the business problem, data processing, modeling, evaluation and deployment. 
 
__Course Objectives__: 

- Understand many of the commonly used data mining algorithms
- Know how to select a proper method and assess the model performance
- Use R to run various data mining methods
- Be able to interpret results to your audiences without relevant background
