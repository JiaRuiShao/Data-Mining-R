
**Course Description**

Computational statistics is a fundamental part of modern data analysis. This course provides an understanding of the principles and concepts of using modern statistical programing languages for data analysis. Students will learn to use R to handle the manipulation of large datasets, as well as to simulate data, import and export data. As an introductory course to statistically-oriented programming, no extensive programming background is assumed. They will gain experience in analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data. Students will learn important ideas of programming and will learn how to fit basic statistical models and assess and present the results.  

**Course Learning Objectives**

● Use R to manipulate, describe and analyze data. 

● Use R to achieve excellence in statistical graphics. 

● Adopt codes of ethical use of statistical methods in the presentation and analysis of data. 

● Apply appropriate statistical tools, techniques, and procedures to real datasets. 

● Master fundamental descriptive and inferential statistical concepts and procedures proficiently.
